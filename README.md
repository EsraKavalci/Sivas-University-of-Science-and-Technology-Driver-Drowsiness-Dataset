The SUST Driver Drowsiness Dataset (SUST-DDD) contains 2 groups of videos, with a total of 19 drivers, 3 females and 16 males.
Participants recorded a video of their driving moments with their own phones in their own vehicles at a desired time.

There are videos labeled drowsy and not drowsy for each participant. Videos named d_X.mp4 are videos in which the participant exhibits drowsy behavior. Videos named n_X.mp4 are videos in which the participant exhibits not-drowsy behavior. During the recordings, the participants were not asked to act in any way, and the reactions and symptoms were recorded in their natural flow.
